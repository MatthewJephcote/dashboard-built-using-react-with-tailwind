# dashboard-built-using-react-with-tailwind

In this project, I have used REACT to rebuild my previous solution of the 'Frontend Mentor' Time Tracking Dashboard challenge.

I based this React version on my original code, which had employed Tailwind, along with a global stylesheet, to override that CSS library's 'opinions' (without the need to resort to 'hardcoding' risky 'Just In Time' styling values).

I sought to 'componentise' as much of the project as seemed reasonable (minimising the creation of single-use components, though including some that conceivably could be repeated on a larger-scale web application), in order to simplify it and enable 'reusability'.

What I enjoyed most in the exercise: Using 'props', to create dynamic components and seeing my page displayed clearly (no longer fully/partially obscured by a 'veil' of error messages) after solving debugging issues.

What I didn't enjoy so much: reorganising my folder/file structure for the project part way through the exercise, along with resulting import/export statement consistency issues.

Key Developer skills employed in this project: Command Line (to download and run 'create-react-app' in relationship with Tailwind), using JavaScript/CSS libraries, (nesting) Flexbox, Transformations and Media Queries.
